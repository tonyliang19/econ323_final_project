    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we aim to **explore the impact of environmental factors on housing prices** using the [Boston Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data.). This dataset contains information on various attributes such as crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more, which are hypothesized to influence housing prices. The project will involve several parts, including data cleaning, visualization, and model building. Our objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and then build a hedonic regression model with multiple inputs. We will utilize various Python techniques learned in this course to explore the real world data and solve economic questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the data, we aim to answer economic questions related to the housing market and explore the real-world application of Python techniques. It is important to note that the dataset has its limitations as it was collected almost 50 years ago, but it still provides an excellent opportunity for us to apply our Python skills and gain insights of housing market."

In addition, we will use side-by-side box plots to visualize the distributions of the continuous variables and detect any potential outliers or anomalies. Moreover, we will leverage other data visualization techniques, such as scatter plots and histograms, to better understand the relationships between the variables and explore potential trends or patterns in the data.
