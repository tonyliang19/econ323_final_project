# Econ 323

- NOT TOO SIMPLE
- Research (ML methods level like CPSC330, Visualizations (matpolotlib, altair) )
	+ Complexity higher --> Maybe could do feature importance viz
	+ Prepocessing could use scikit-learn ?
	+ Could use multiple metrics:
		* Inference: AIC/BIC, mallow CP, ...
		* Prediction: RMSE, MAE 
- LASSO
- Decision Tree
- Manual train/compute model by hand
	+ Regression use $(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y$ like matrix multiplication with numpy?
	+ Manual split train/test
